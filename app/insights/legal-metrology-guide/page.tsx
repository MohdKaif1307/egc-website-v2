              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Legal Metrology plays a crucial role in ensuring fair trade practices and consumer protection in India. 
                As we move into 2025, businesses need to stay updated with the latest regulations and compliance requirements 
                to avoid penalties and maintain trust with their customers.
              </p>

              <h2>What is Legal Metrology?</h2>
              <p>
                Legal Metrology refers to the science of measurement and its application to trade and commerce. 
                It ensures that measurements are accurate, reliable, and consistent across all business transactions. 
                In India, this is governed by the Legal Metrology Act, 2009, and its various rules and regulations.
              </p>

              <h2>Key Requirements for Businesses</h2>
              <h3>1. Registration and Licensing</h3>
              <p>
                All businesses involved in manufacturing, importing, or selling pre-packaged commodities must register

              <p>
                The Legal Metrology Department is increasingly adopting digital processes:

                <li>Blockchain-based certification</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Enhanced Penalties</h3>
              <p>
                The government has increased penalties for non-compliance:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>First offense: ₹25,000 to ₹100,000</li>
                <li>Subsequent offenses: ₹50,000 to ₹200,000</li>
                <li>Imprisonment up to 1 year for serious violations</li>
                <li>Seizure of non-compliant goods and equipment</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Best Practices for Compliance</h2>
              <h3>1. Regular Audits</h3>
              <p>
                Conduct regular internal audits to ensure all measuring instruments are properly calibrated 
                and verified. Maintain detailed records of all verifications and calibrations.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Staff Training</h3>
              <p>
                Train your staff on Legal Metrology requirements and best practices. Regular training sessions 
                help maintain compliance and reduce the risk of violations.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Documentation</h3>
              <p>
                Maintain comprehensive documentation including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Registration certificates</li>
                <li>Verification reports</li>
                <li>Calibration certificates</li>
                <li>Inspection reports</li>
                <li>Complaint records</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>4. Technology Adoption</h3>
              <p>
                Invest in modern measuring equipment with digital capabilities. This not only improves accuracy 
                but also helps with compliance monitoring and reporting.
              </p>

              <h2>Common Compliance Issues</h2>
              <h3>1. Incorrect Net Quantity Declaration</h3>
              <p>
                Many businesses face issues with incorrect net quantity declarations. Ensure that the declared 
                quantity matches the actual quantity within permissible limits.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Expired Verification Stamps</h3>
              <p>
                Measuring instruments must be re-verified periodically. Keep track of verification expiry dates 
                and schedule re-verification well in advance.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Incomplete Labeling</h3>
              <p>
                Ensure all required information is clearly visible on product labels. Use appropriate font sizes 
                and ensure good contrast for readability.
              </p>
